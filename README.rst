Warning
=======

This is a preliminary program code!

I wrote ``core`` for my master's thesis.
The work isn't finished yet, so changes in the code are very likely! 

Note
----

   If you have any problems, found bugs in the code or have feature request
   comments or questions, please feel free to send a mail to `Jürgen Hackl`_.

Purpose
=======

CoRe (Concrete Reliability) is a python module for computing Reinforced
Concrete Structural Reliability in Python.

Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of
problems.

``core`` needs ``pyre`` and ``pybn`` to work!
