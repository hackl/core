CoRe is known to run on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows, but in theory should be
able to work on just about any platform for which Python, a Fortran compiler
and the NumPy SciPy, and Math modules are available. However, installing some
extra depencies can greatly improve PyRe's performance and versatility. The
following describes the required and optional dependencies and takes you
through the installation process.


Dependencies
============

CoRe requires some prerequisite packages to be present on the system.
Fortunately, there are currently only a few hard dependencies, and all are
freely available online.

* `PyRe`_ : Structural Reliability with Python.

* `PyBN`_ : Simple Bayesian Networks with Python.

* `Python`_ version 2.7 or later.

* `NumPy`_ : The fundamental scientific programming package, it
  provides a multidimensional array type and many useful functions for
  numerical analysis.

* `SciPy`_ : Library of algorithms for mathematics, science and engineering.

* `IPython`_ (optional): An enhanced interactive Python shell and an
  architecture for interactive parallel computing.
